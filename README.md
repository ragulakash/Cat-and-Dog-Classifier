# Cat-and-Dog-Classifier
A deep learning-based binary image classifier that identifies whether an uploaded image is of a cat or a dog, built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook using TensorFlow/Keras. The project covers data preprocessing, CNN model development, training, evaluation, and prediction visualization â€” all in one interactive notebook.
