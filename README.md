# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier - Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates a binary image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between images of **cats** and **dogs**.

The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated on a sample dataset. The entire workflow — from loading the data to training and testing the model — is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook.
